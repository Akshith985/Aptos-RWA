# Contributing to Aptos Invoice RWA

Welcome! I'm excited that you want to contribute to the future of RWA on Aptos.

## 🏗 How to Get Started
1. **Explore Issues:** Look for the `good first issue` label in our GitHub Issues.
2. **Fork & Clone:** Create your own branch for any feature or bug fix.

## 🎯 Contribution Areas
We are currently seeking help in:
- **Logic Extensions:** Adding `due_date` and `penalty_fee` fields to the Invoice struct.
- **Frontend Development:** Building a Next.js dashboard to view these objects.
- **Documentation:** Adding comments and technical guides for the Move modules.
- **Testing:** Writing unit tests for the minting and transfer logic.

## 📝 Standards
- **Clarity:** Every Move function should have a comment explaining its purpose.
- **Safety:** Use `assert!` to handle error cases and prevent invalid states.
- **Naming:** Follow the Aptos naming conventions (`snake_case` for functions, `PascalCase` for structs).

## 🚀 Submission Process
1. Commit your changes with a clear message (e.g., `feat: added status field to invoice`).
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.
3. Describe the problem you solved and provide a link to the Testnet transaction if applicable.

**Thank you for building!**
